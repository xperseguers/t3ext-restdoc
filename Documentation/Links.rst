How to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension is using the same contribution workflow as for TYPO3 Core, but
with GitHub PRs for the review process. Please read more about the workflow in
the
`TYPO3 Contribution Guide <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ContributionWorkflowGuide/>`__.

  the suggested enhancement
- `PSR-12`_ coding guidelines are enforced
- Commit message complies to the `format used by TYPO3`_ (the "releases:" line
  is useless here)
- Unique logical change per patch [#]_

.. [#] The term "patch" is used in the sense of "patch set" in Gerrit, and may
   be the result of multiple (amended) commits.

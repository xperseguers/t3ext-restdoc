Generating the documentation as JSON
------------------------------------

When kickstarting a project, Sphinx creates a Makefile with different output. Generating your documentation is just a
matter of running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /path/to/documentation
   $ make json

The documentation will be created in a ``json`` directory within the ``build`` (or ``_build``) directory. This ``json``
directory is what should be published to your TYPO3 website, typically somewhere within ``fileadmin/``.

.. tip::

   Instead of manually setting up a Sphinx environment on your computer, you may consider
   using `TYPO3 extension Sphinx <https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sphinx>`_ available off TER.

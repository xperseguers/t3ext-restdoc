description = Seamlessly embeds Sphinx/reStructuredText-based
      documentation into your TYPO3 website. Instead of publishing
      your various manual, in-house documents, guides, references, ...
      solely as PDF, render them as JSON and use this extension to
      show them as part of your website to enhance the overall user
      experience and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Lets you merge
      the chapter structure with the breadcrumb menu and much more.
      Documentation styles automatically inherit from your corporate
      design.

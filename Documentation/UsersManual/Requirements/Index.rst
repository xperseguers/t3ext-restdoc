Requirements
------------

You need a documentation written in reStructuredText and as a Sphinx project. Please visit https://wiki.typo3.org/ReST
for further information. You may consider using `TYPO3 extension Sphinx <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sphinx>`_
to easily set up your environment and work on your own documentation.

The main documentation file should be named ``Index.rst`` (to match the convention of the TYPO3 Documentation Team).
If you choose to name it "index.rst" instead (lower case), or want to use another arbitrary name, make sure to update
the :ref:`default TypoScript settings <ts-plugin-tx-restdoc-pi1-defaultFile>` accordingly.
